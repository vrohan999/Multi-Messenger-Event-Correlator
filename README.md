I’m submitting our team’s project for the hackathon. While collaboration within the team turned out to be limited, I was determined not to let that stop us from participating.
Since I don’t have a programming background, I relied on Lovable and other AI tools to design and build the prototype.

I completely understand if you decide not to select us or even remove our team from consideration based on the circumstances. Regardless of the outcome, I’m grateful for the chance to share this effort and to have participated in the process.

Thank you for your time and understanding,
CØSMIC CODΞX
