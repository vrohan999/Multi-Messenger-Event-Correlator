# 🌌 Multi-Messenger Event Correlator

I’m submitting our team’s project for the hackathon. While collaboration within the team turned out to be limited,  
I was determined not to let that stop us from participating.  

Since I don’t have a programming background, I relied on **Lovable** and other AI tools to design and build the prototype.  

I completely understand if you decide **not to select us** or even **remove our team from consideration** based on the circumstances.  
Regardless of the outcome, I’m grateful for the chance to share this effort and to have participated in the process.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Node.js
- Make sure **Node.js ≥ 18** is installed.  
- Download it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if needed.

### 2. Install all dependencies (including development packages)
From the project root (where `package.json` is located), run:

```bash
npm install
```
This will download all required dependencies—both production and development—
and recreate the node_modules folder exactly as needed.

### 3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the app and display a local URL (for example: http://localhost:5173).
